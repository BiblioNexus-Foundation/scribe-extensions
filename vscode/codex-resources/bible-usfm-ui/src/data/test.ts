 \\v 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
 \\v 2 When he began to create the earth, it was shapeless and completely desolate. Darkness covered the surface of the deep water. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the water.
  
 \\s5
 \\v 3 God said, "I command there to be light," and there was light.
 \\v 4 God was pleased with the light. Then he made the light shine in some places at certain times, while in other places there was still darkness.
 \\v 5 He named the light "day," and he named the darkness "night." This was an evening and morning, the first day.

 \\v 6 Then God said, "I command that there be an empty space like a huge dome to separate the water into two parts."
 \\v 7 And that is what happened. God made the empty space like a huge dome and it separated the water that is above it from the water on the earth that is below it.
 \\v 8 God named the space like a huge dome "sky." This was an evening and morning, the second day.

 \\v 9 Then God said, "I command the water that is below the sky to come together, and dry ground to appear and rise above it." And that is what happened.
 \\v 10 God gave to the ground the name "earth," and he gave to the water that came together the name "oceans." God was pleased with the earth and the oceans.

 \\v 11 Then God said, "I command the earth to produce many kinds of plants that reproduce themselvesâ€”plants that will produce seeds and trees that will produce fruit with their seed in it." And that is what happened.
 \\v 12 Then plants grew on the earth. Each kind of plant began to produce its own kind of seed, and each kind of tree produced fruit with its seed in it. God was pleased with the plants and trees.
 \\v 13 This was an evening and morning, the third day.`
