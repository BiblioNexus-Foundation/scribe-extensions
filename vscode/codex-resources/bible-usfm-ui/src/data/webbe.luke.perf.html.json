He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. <span class=\"verses\">6</span>They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. <span class=\"verses\">7</span>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">8</span>Now while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his division <span class=\"verses\">9</span>according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. <span class=\"verses\">10</span>The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">11</span>An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. <span class=\"verses\">12</span>Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. <span class=\"verses\">13</span>But the angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard. Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. <span class=\"verses\">14</span>You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. <span class=\"verses\">15</span>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. <span class=\"verses\">16</span>He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. <span class=\"verses\">17</span>He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’<span class=\"graft xref\" data-graftType=\"xref\" data-target=\"ODQ5YWNkYTgt\" data-nBlocks=\"1\" data-previewText=\"1:17 Malachi 4:6\"></span>&#8239; and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">18</span>Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">19</span>The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. <span class=\"verses\">20</span>Behold,<span class=\"graft footnote\" data-graftType=\"footnote\" data-target=\"ZjU3ODE3MWEt\" data-nBlocks=\"1\" data-previewText=\"1:20 “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

They perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute. <span class=\"verses\">23</span>When the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house. <span class=\"verses\">24</span>After these days Elizabeth his wife conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying, <span class=\"verses\">25</span>“Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach amongst men.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">26</span>Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, <span class=\"verses\">27</span>to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of David’s house. The virgin’s name was Mary. <span class=\"verses\">28</span>Having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, you highly favoured one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you amongst women!”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">29</span>But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be. <span class=\"verses\">30</span>The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. <span class=\"verses\">31</span>Behold, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and shall name him ‘Jesus.’ <span class=\"verses\">32</span>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, <span class=\"verses\">33</span>and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">34</span>Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">35</span>The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God. <span class=\"verses\">36</span>Behold, Elizabeth your relative also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. <span class=\"verses\">37</span>For nothing spoken by God is impossible.”<span class=\"graft footnote\" data-graftType=\"footnote\" data-target=\"MWQwNGNmYWEt\" data-nBlocks=\"1\" data-previewText=\"1:37 or, “For everything spoken by God is possible.”\"></span>&#8239;</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">38</span>Mary said, “Behold, the servant of the Lord;

and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. <span class=\"verses\">42</span>She called out with a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! <span class=\"verses\">43</span>Why am I so favoured, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? <span class=\"verses\">44</span>For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leapt in my womb for joy! <span class=\"verses\">45</span>Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">46</span>Mary said,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\">“My soul magnifies the Lord.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\"><span class=\"verses\">47</span>My spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\"><span class=\"verses\">48</span>for he has looked at the humble state of his servant.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\">For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\"><span class=\"verses\">49</span>For he who is mighty has done great things for me.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">Holy is his name.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\"><span class=\"verses\">50</span>His mercy is for generations and generations on those who fear him.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">51</span>He has shown strength with his arm.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">52</span>He has put down princes from their thrones,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">and has exalted the lowly.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">53</span>He has filled the hungry with good things.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">He has sent the rich away empty.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">54</span>He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\"><span class=\"verses\">55</span>as he spoke to our fathers,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">to Abraham and his offspring<span class=\"graft footnote\" data-graftType=\"footnote\" data-target=\"MjJjMDI3YWYt\" data-nBlocks=\"1\" data-previewText=\"1:55 or, seed\"></span>&#8239;

and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. <span class=\"verses\">60</span>His mother answered, “Not so; but he will be called John.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">61</span>They said to her, “There is no one amongst your relatives who is called by this name.” <span class=\"verses\">62</span>They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">63</span>He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, “His name is John.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\">They all marvelled. <span class=\"verses\">64</span>His mouth was opened immediately and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God. <span class=\"verses\">65</span>Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea. <span class=\"verses\">66</span>All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of the Lord was with him.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">67</span>His father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">68</span>“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">for he has visited and redeemed his people;</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">69</span>and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\"><span class=\"verses\">70</span>(as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old),</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\"><span class=\"verses\">71</span>salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us;</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">72</span>to show mercy towards our fathers,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">to remember his holy covenant,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">73</span>the oath which he swore to Abraham our father,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\"><span class=\"verses\">74</span>to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">should serve him without fear,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\"><span class=\"verses\">75</span>in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">76</span>And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\"><span class=\"verses\">77</span>to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">78</span>because of the tender mercy of our God,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">by which the dawn from on high will visit us,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\"><span class=\"verses\">79</span>to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death;</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">to guide our feet into the way of peace.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">80</span>The child was growing and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"chapter\">2</span><span class=\"verses\">1</span>Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. <span class=\"verses\">2</span>This was the first enrolment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. <span class=\"verses\">3</span>All went to enrol themselves, everyone to his own city. <span class=\"verses\">4</span>Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, <span class=\"verses\">5</span>to enrol himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">6</span>While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth. <span class=\"verses\">7</span>She gave birth to her firstborn son.

Joseph and his mother didn’t know it, <span class=\"verses\">44</span>but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they looked for him amongst their relatives and acquaintances. <span class=\"verses\">45</span>When they didn’t find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him. <span class=\"verses\">46</span>After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. <span class=\"verses\">47</span>All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. <span class=\"verses\">48</span>When they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us this way?

Then they will fast in those days.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">36</span>He also told a parable to them. “No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old.  <span class=\"verses\">37</span>No one puts new wine into old wine skins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled and the skins will be destroyed.  <span class=\"verses\">38</span>But new wine must be put into fresh wine skins, and both are preserved.  <span class=\"verses\">39</span>No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"chapter\">6</span><span class=\"verses\">1</span>Now on the second Sabbath after the first, he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands. <span class=\"verses\">2</span>But some of the Pharisees said to them, “Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">3</span>Jesus, answering them, said, “Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him,  <span class=\"verses\">4</span>how he entered into God’s house, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?” <span class=\"verses\">5</span>He said to them, “The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">6</span>It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered. <span class=\"verses\">7</span>The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him. <span class=\"verses\">8</span>But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Rise up and stand in the middle.” He arose and stood. <span class=\"verses\">9</span>Then Jesus said to them, “I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?” <span class=\"verses\">10</span>He looked around at them all, and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other. <span class=\"verses\">11</span>But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">12</span>In these days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God. <span class=\"verses\">13</span>When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles: <span class=\"verses\">14</span>Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew; <span class=\"verses\">15</span>Matthew; Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus; Simon who was called the Zealot; <span class=\"verses\">16</span>Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">17</span>He came down with them and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases, <span class=\"verses\">18</span>as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits; and they were being healed. <span class=\"verses\">19</span>All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out of him and healed them all.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">20</span>He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said:</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\">“Blessed are you who are poor,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">for God’s Kingdom is yours.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">21</span>Blessed are you who hunger now,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">for you will be filled.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\">Blessed are you who weep now,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">for you will laugh.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">22</span>Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\"><span class=\"verses\">23</span>Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.</div>\n    <div class=\"block b\"></div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">24</span>“But woe to you who are rich!</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">For you have received your consolation.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">25</span>Woe to you, you who are full now,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">for you will be hungry.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\">Woe to you who laugh now,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">for you will mourn and weep.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">26</span>Woe, <span class=\"graft footnote\" data-graftType=\"footnote\" data-target=\"MWVhZTBlMTEt\" data-nBlocks=\"1\" data-previewText=\"6:26 TR adds “to you”\"></span>&#8239; when<span class=\"graft footnote\" data-graftType=\"footnote\" data-target=\"ZmY1NGI5Mzgt\" data-nBlocks=\"1\" data-previewText=\"6:26 TR adds “all”\"></span>&#8239; men speak well of you,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">27</span>“But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,  <span class=\"verses\">28</span>bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.  <span class=\"verses\">29</span>To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don’t withhold your coat also.  <span class=\"verses\">30</span>Give to everyone who asks you, and don’t ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">31</span>“As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">32</span>“If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?

It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">46</span>An argument arose amongst them about which of them was the greatest. <span class=\"verses\">47</span>Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side, <span class=\"verses\">48</span>and said to them, “Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least amongst you all, this one will be great.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">49</span>John answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow with us.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">50</span>Jesus said to him, “Don’t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">51</span>It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem <span class=\"verses\">52</span>and sent messengers before his face. They went and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him. <span class=\"verses\">53</span>They didn’t receive him, because he was travelling with his face set towards Jerusalem. <span class=\"verses\">54</span>When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky and destroy them, just as Elijah did?”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">55</span>But he turned and rebuked them, “You don’t know of what kind of spirit you are.  <span class=\"verses\">56</span>For the Son of Man didn’t come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\">They went to another village. <span class=\"verses\">57</span>As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">58</span>Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">59</span>He said to another, “Follow me!”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\">But he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">60</span>But Jesus said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce God’s Kingdom.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">61</span>Another also said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">62</span>But Jesus said to him, “No one, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is fit for God’s Kingdom.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"chapter\">10</span><span class=\"verses\">1</span>Now after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of him<span class=\"graft footnote\" data-graftType=\"footnote\" data-target=\"NWFjMjVmZTgt\" data-nBlocks=\"1\" data-previewText=\"10:1 literally, “before his face”\"></span>&#8239; into every city and place where he was about to come. <span class=\"verses\">2</span>Then he said to them, “The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the labourers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out labourers into his harvest.  <span class=\"verses\">3</span>Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs amongst wolves.  <span class=\"verses\">4</span>Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals.

For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.  <span class=\"verses\">14</span>But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgement than for you.  <span class=\"verses\">15</span>You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades. <span class=\"graft footnote\" data-graftType=\"footnote\" data-target=\"Y2YwOGU0NWIt\" data-nBlocks=\"1\" data-previewText=\"10:15 Hades is the lower realm of the dead, or Hell.\"></span>&#8239; <span class=\"verses\">16</span>Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me.

Nothing will in any way hurt you.  <span class=\"verses\">20</span>Nevertheless, don’t rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">21</span>In that same hour, Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, “I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">22</span>Turning to the disciples, he said, “All things have been delivered to me by my Father.

When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.  <span class=\"verses\">32</span>In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.  <span class=\"verses\">33</span>But a certain Samaritan, as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion,  <span class=\"verses\">34</span>came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.  <span class=\"verses\">35</span>On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the host, and said to him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.’  <span class=\"verses\">36</span>Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbour to him who fell amongst the robbers?”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">37</span>He said, “He who showed mercy on him.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\">Then Jesus said to him, “Go and do likewise.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">38</span>As they went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. <span class=\"verses\">39</span>She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard his word. <span class=\"verses\">40</span>But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">41</span>Jesus answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,  <span class=\"verses\">42</span>but one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"chapter\">11</span><span class=\"verses\">1</span>When he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">2</span>He said to them, “When you pray, say,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\">‘Our Father in heaven,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">may your name be kept holy.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\">May your Kingdom come.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">3</span>Give us day by day our daily bread.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\"><span class=\"verses\">4</span>Forgive us our sins,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.</div>\n    <div class=\"block q\">Bring us not into temptation,</div>\n    <div class=\"block q2\">but deliver us from the evil one.’”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">5</span>He said to them, “Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight and tell him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,  <span class=\"verses\">6</span>for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,’  <span class=\"verses\">7</span>and he from within will answer and say, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I can’t get up and give it to you’?  <span class=\"verses\">8</span>I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">9</span>“I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.  <span class=\"verses\">10</span>For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds.

When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marvelled. <span class=\"verses\">15</span>But some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.” <span class=\"verses\">16</span>Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven. <span class=\"verses\">17</span>But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.  <span class=\"verses\">18</span>If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.  <span class=\"verses\">19</span>But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.  <span class=\"verses\">20</span>But if I by God’s finger cast out demons, then God’s Kingdom has come to you.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">21</span>“When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.  <span class=\"verses\">22</span>But when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armour in which he trusted, and divides his plunder.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">23</span>“He who is not with me is against me.

The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">27</span>It came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice and said to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">28</span>But he said, “On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">29</span>When the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say, “This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.  <span class=\"verses\">30</span>For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so the Son of Man will also be to this generation.  <span class=\"verses\">31</span>The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgement with the men of this generation and will condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.  <span class=\"verses\">32</span>The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgement with this generation, and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">33</span>“No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.  <span class=\"verses\">34</span>The lamp of the body is the eye.

He went in and sat at the table. <span class=\"verses\">38</span>When the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed himself before dinner. <span class=\"verses\">39</span>The Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.  <span class=\"verses\">40</span>You foolish ones, didn’t he who made the outside make the inside also?  <span class=\"verses\">41</span>But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.  <span class=\"verses\">42</span>But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and God’s love. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.  <span class=\"verses\">43</span>Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.  <span class=\"verses\">44</span>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk over them don’t know it.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">45</span>One of the lawyers answered him, “Teacher, in saying this you insult us also.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">46</span>He said, “Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won’t even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.  <span class=\"verses\">47</span>Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.  <span class=\"verses\">48</span>So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.  <span class=\"verses\">49</span>Therefore also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,  <span class=\"verses\">50</span>that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation,  <span class=\"verses\">51</span>from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.  <span class=\"verses\">52</span>Woe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn’t enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.”</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"verses\">53</span>As he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him, <span class=\"verses\">54</span>lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.</div>\n    <div class=\"block p\"><span class=\"chapter\">12</span><span class=\"verses\">1</span>Meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, “Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.  <span class=\"verses\">2</span>But there is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known.  <span class=\"verses\">3</span>Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light.
